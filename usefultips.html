    USEFUL TIPS

  <h2>
    ヒントとコツ
    </h2>
 
  <p>
    If you've arrived here, it means that you have finally consumed all the lessons for this website! To lead you on your journey. This is the final page of encouragement to help you through the long journey of language learning. This page will also provide recommendations on what books to read as well as shows to watch aisde from anime.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Practice, れんしゅう! Practice!
    </h2> 
    <p>
      <br><br> Like anything that we’ve been taught our whole lives, practice makes perfect. Make it a fact to shell out a few minutes of your time daily to practice the writing system as well as simple words that you’ve learned. It is recommended to have your own language notebook for yourself so that you may look back at your progress once you’ve filled the whole book. <br><br>
    Whats that word? <br>
     Look up words you use daily. By knowing the name of everyday items, it helps in engaging your mind and subconscious into retaining the word in Japanese longer. Which leads me to another point that connects to this tip.<br><br>
    Immerse yourself <br>
    They say the best and fastest way to learn a language is to live in the country that speaks it. But lets be real-- we cant all just pack up and go leave everything we know behind, right? Well another way to immerse yourself in the Japanese language is to consume their products, reading, watching shows/anime and listening to music are just a few of the many ways you can incorporate Japanese to your life. <br><br></p>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p><br>
      Shonen Manga<br>
      Shonen Manga, is one of the several kinds of manga. It is aimed usually towards kids ages 9 to 18 years old. What makes this manga particularly useful for those looking to read books is that it has furigana beside unfamiliar kanji. Furigana is a Japanese reading aid that consists of smaller kana written above or next to kanji to indicate their pronunciation. Check out Japan's famous manga Shonen Jump! They produce one of the biggest manga names such as Haikyuu! Attack On Titan, One Piece and several others.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Language books</h2><br>
    <p>
      With learning Japanese, there are fortunately a whole lot of language books that could be easily accessible. With that, it gets quite overwhelming as to what kind of books would be a great read. The mentioned books below are based off how digestible it is to read and comprehend as well as understand the exercises that come along with it.<br><br>
Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese (English and Japanese Edition)<br>
This language learning book is well rounded as it covers speaking, listening, reading and writing to cultivate overall language ability. The book also includes and audio CD companion and guides you through the exercises in each page. <br><br>
Minna no Nihongo<br>
This series takes you from elementary to intermediate levels as it is written entirely in Japanese. Although total immersion is beneficial for learners it may be deemed difficult studying yourselves. Its highly suggested that this book be used for those that have a solid understanding of hiragana, katakana and some kanji in order to utilize this book to its full potential.<br><br>
Nihongo Sou-Matome<br>
For those looking for a study guide for the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test). This series is useful. For each proficiency level there are books broken down into smaller, digestible and specific segments. Depending on the level some contain Grammar, Kanji, Vocabulary and Listening Comprehension.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2> Recommended shows</h2>
    <p>
    <br>Aside from the usual anime shows that Japan is famously known for, it is worth mentioning that although it would be a good language practice, it does not portray how Japanese people would converse with one another. With that said, if you're fond of drama and reality TV shows here is one up for you.<br><br>
      Terrace House<br>
      Terrace house (テラスハウス) is a reality show created in Japan. The show follows the lives of six strangers, three men and three women from different walks of life that live together while getting to know each other and possibly date each other. There are currently five series. What makes this show great for language learners is that it uses conversational japanese. You will be able to learn the grammatical structure as well as learn new words along the way.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Japanese Music</h2>
    <p>
      Whats another way to be entertained as well as immerse yourself in Japanese culture? Well one would be music! Listening to Japanese music can aid in familiarizing yourself with the pronounciations as well as vocabulary and sentence structure as you groove to the beat. Artists that I would recommend are Yorushika, Sakanaction, ATARASHII GAKKO, OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM, AIMYON and back number to name a few.<br><br>
